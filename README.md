## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

An iOS app created in SwiftUI. An unofficial API was used for the major functionality of the application, alongside other packages.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Since the project was pushed from xCode, all of the dependencies should be installed automatically after downloading the project from Github.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The app opens up with a prompt for the user to enter their Apex Legends username. After this, the user can see their selected legend, as well as a lot of data about their account, some of which cannot be accessed in the game! Besides that, the user can calculate how many Apex Packs they opened using the second tab. On the third tab, the user can spin the wheel to decide where they want to land in game.
